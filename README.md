A modern game referee system developed for WPI's CS4341 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course, taught by Professor Ruiz in C Term 2025. This referee system powers both Tic-tac-toe and Lasker Morris competitions, providing a robust platform for AI development and testing.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
- git

### Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jake-molnia/cs4341-referee.git
```

## üéÆ Running Games

### Tic-tac-toe

```bash
cs4341-referee tictactoe -p "python player.py" --visual
```

### Lasker Morris

```bash
cs4341-referee laskermorris -p1 "python player1.py" -p2 "python player2.py" --visual
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Options

### Common Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --visual` | Enable web visualization | True |
| `-r, --random-assignment` | Randomize player colors/symbols | True |
| `-t, --timeout` | Move timeout in seconds | 5 |
| `-l, --log` | Enable detailed logging | False |
| `-d, --debug` | Enable debug output | False |
| `--port` | Specify the port the game visualization is hosted on | 8000 |

_Note: logging is not yet supported_

### Game-Specific Options

#### Tic-tac-toe
- `-p, --player`: Command to run the player program
- `-p2, --player2`: Optional command to run second player program (leave blank for self play)

#### Lasker Morris
- `-p1, --player1`: Command for first player
- `-p2, --player2`: Command for second player

## ü§ñ Player Communication Protocol

Players communicate with the referee through standard input/output streams. Here's how it works:

### Game Start
- First player receives: `"blue"` (Lasker Morris) or `"X"` (Tic-tac-toe)
- Second player receives: `"orange"` (Lasker Morris) or `"O"` (Tic-tac-toe)

### Move Format

#### Tic-tac-toe
```
<column><row>
Example: "b2" (center position)
```

#### Lasker Morris
```
<source> <target> <remove>
Example: "h1 d1 r0" (place piece from hand)
Example: "d1 d2 e3" (move piece and capture)
```

### Python Player Template
```python
import sys

def main():
    # Read initial color/symbol
    player_id = input().strip()

    while True:
        try:
            # Read opponent's move or game start
            game_input = input().strip()

            # Your move logic here
            move = "your_move_here"

            # Send move to referee
            print(move, flush=True)

        except EOFError:
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## üéØ Game Rules

### Tic-tac-toe
- 3x3 grid
- Players alternate placing X's and O's
- First to get three in a row wins
- Game ends in draw if board fills without winner

### Lasker Morris
- Players start with 10 pieces each
- Pieces can be placed from hand or moved on board
- Moving to adjacent positions only (except when player has 3 pieces)
- Forming three in a row (mill) allows capturing opponent's piece
- Player loses when reduced to fewer than 3 pieces
- Draw occurs if same position repeats 3 times

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Visualization

The referee includes a modern web interface that shows:
- Real-time game state
- Move history with navigation
- Player information
- Game status and results

To use:
1. Start game with `--visual` flag
2. Open browser to displayed URL (typically `http://localhost:8000`)
3. Watch game progress in real-time

## üîç Error Handling

The referee handles various game situations:

- Invalid moves: Game ends, opponent wins
- Timeout violations: Player loses turn
- Communication errors: Game ends, opponent wins
- Protocol violations: Game ends, opponent wins
